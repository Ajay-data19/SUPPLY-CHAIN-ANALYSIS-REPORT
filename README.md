## Project Overview
This Supply Chain Analysis Report was meticulously developed as part of my active participation in the Onyx Data November 2024 DataDNA Challenge. The primary objective of this project is to leverage advanced analytics and visualization techniques to gain in-depth insights into various aspects of supply chain management. The analysis focuses on three key areas:

**Performance Overview:** Evaluating critical metrics such as revenue, cost, profit, and production efficiency. This section aims to identify actionable insights that can drive strategic decisions and improve overall operational performance.

**Quality and Production:** Analyzing defect rates, manufacturing costs, and production volumes to highlight areas for process improvement. This part of the report seeks to provide recommendations for enhancing product quality and optimizing production processes.

**Shipping Analysis:** Gaining comprehensive visibility into transportation modes, routes, and logistics performance. The goal here is to identify opportunities for cost and time optimization, thereby improving the efficiency and reliability of the supply chain.

Through this project, I aim to demonstrate my analytical skills and my ability to derive meaningful insights from complex datasets.

## Problem Statement
The supply chain generates a vast amount of data that often remains underutilized, hindering the ability to make data-driven decisions. Key challenges include understanding profitability drivers, identifying defect patterns, and optimizing transportation routes and modes. This project aims to address these challenges by providing a comprehensive analysis of revenue trends, defect rates, lead times, and transportation performance to enhance operational efficiency and support strategic decision-making.

## Process
`Data Preparation (Power Query Editor)`
- The process began with thorough data cleaning, including handling missing values, removing redundant columns, resolving duplicates, and adjusting data types to prepare the dataset for analysis.
  
`DAX Measures`
- Minor measures were created using Data Analysis Expressions (DAX). DAX is a formula language used in Power BI to create custom calculations, aggregations, and metrics.

`Report Creation`
- Using the transformed data from Power Query Editor, a multifaceted Power BI report was created. This report is designed to provide a 360-degree view of the business based on the data.

## Report Previews
### Structure:
The Supply Chain Analysis Report comprises several key sections, each providing unique insights into various aspects of supply chain management:

**Introduction Page:** Serves as a navigation hub with links to other sections within the report.

**Performance Overview:** Evaluates critical metrics such as revenue, cost, profit, and production efficiency to identify actionable insights.

**Quality and Production:** Analyzes defect rates, manufacturing costs, and production volumes to highlight areas for process improvement.

**Shipping Analysis:** Provides visibility into transportation modes, routes, and logistics performance for cost and time optimization.
